Have you ever been trying to kill a mob and a player gets the last hit!? This plugin prevents that! When a player hits a mob it will then block it from being hit by anyone else. Judged on the time specified in the plugin, when the time expires then other players will be able to hit it again. This soon will be updated for other requested features in the comments! :) - Jared
